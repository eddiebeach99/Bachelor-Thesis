Bachelor Thesis: Lightness and Brightness Scaling in Realistic Scenes
=====================================================================

Overview
--------
This repository contains the code and data for my Bachelor Thesis on 
**Lightness and Brightness Scaling in Realistic Scenes**. The project explores 
how subjects perceive lightness and brightness under different 
realism conditions. The repository includes the subject responses and 
their corresponding ordinal embeddings, along with the code used to create 
the plots and generate the embeddings.

Repository Contents
-------------------
1. **Data**
   - Subject responses for different realism conditions
   - Ordinal embeddings of the responses corresponding to each realism condition.

2. **Code**
   - Python scripts for generating the **plots** that appear in the thesis report.
   - Code for the creation of the **ordinal embeddings** from the subject responses.
